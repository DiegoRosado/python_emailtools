# send_email
`send_email` is a python script for sending emails easily from the command line o from another script.

The main goal is to have a pretty easy but powerful tool to send emails.

## Configuring the email settings
In this same directory there is a config.py file with the info of the email server and destination

## Email subject and body
The subject and the body are so far hardcoded in the main python file, send_email.py

## Account password
The password has to be typed everytime to avoid leaking of passwords
